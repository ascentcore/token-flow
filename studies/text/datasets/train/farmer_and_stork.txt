Finding that cranes were destroying his newly sown corn, a farmer one evening set a net in his field to catch the destructive birds.

When he went to examine the net next morning he found a number of cranes and also a stork.

Release me, I beseech you, cried the stork, for I have eaten none of your corn, nor have I done you any harm. I am a poor innocent stork, as you may see - a most dutiful bird, I honor my father and mother.

I... But the farmer cut him short. All this may be true enough, I dare say, but I have caught you with those were destroying my crops, and you must suffer with the company in which you are found. People are judged by the company they keep.

THE BOY WHO CRIED 'WOLF'  A tortoise one day met a hare who made fun of her.

My, my, you move so slowly, you will never get far! The tortoises, upset by the hare’s manner, said, Let’s have a race and see who is faster. The hare laughed and said, You must be joking! But all right, we’ll see who reaches the other side of the hill first. Off he ran, leaving the tortoise far behind.

After a while, the hare stopped to wait for the tortoise to come long.

He waited and waited till he felt sleepy. I might as well take a nap, he thought. Even if she catches up with me, I can easily win the race. So he lay down under a shady tree and closed his eyes.

When the tortoise passed the sleeping hare, she walked on slowly but steadily. By the time the hare woke up, the tortoise was near the finishing line. He ran as fast as he could, but he could not catch up with the tortoise.

Slow and steady can win the race.
