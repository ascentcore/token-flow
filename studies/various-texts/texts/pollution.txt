Air pollution is when unwanted chemicals, gasses, and particles enter the air and the atmosphere causing harm to animals and damaging the natural cycles of the Earth.
Some sources of air pollution come from nature. These include eruptions of volcanoes, dust storms, and forest fires.
Human activity is a major cause of air pollution, especially in large cities. Human air pollution is caused by things such as factories, power plants, cars, airplanes, chemicals, fumes from spray cans, and methane gas from landfills.
One of the ways that humans cause the most air pollution is by burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas. When we burn fossil fuels this releases all sorts of gasses into the air causing air pollution such as smog.
Air pollution and the release of gasses into the atmosphere can have many negative effects on the environment.
Anytime you can use less energy, like electricity or gasoline, it can help reduce air pollution. You can help by turning off the lights when leaving your room and not leaving the TV or computer on when you're not using it. Driving less helps a lot too. Be sure to talk to your parents about carpooling with friends and planning errands so that you can get them all done in a single trip. This saves money on gas as well, which everyone likes!
