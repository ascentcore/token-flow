Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained, All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing. Edison replied very confidently, Oh, we have come a long way and we have learned a lot. We now know that there are two thousand elements which we cannot use to make a good light bulb. DON'T CHANGE THE WORLD  Once there was a shepherd boy who had to look after a flock of sheep. One day, he felt bored and decided to play a trick on the villagers. He shouted, Help! Wolf! Wolf! The villagers heard his cries and rushed out of the village to help the shepherd boy. When they reached him, they asked, Where is the wolf? The shepherd boy laughed loudly, Ha, Ha, Ha! I fooled all of you.
I was only playing a trick on you. A few days later, the shepherd boy played this trick again.
Again he cried, Help! Help! Wolf! Wolf! Again, the villagers rushed up the hill to help him and again they found that boy had tricked them. They were very angry with him for being so naughty.
Then, some time later, a wolf went into the field. The wolf attacked one sheep, and then another and another. The shepherd boy ran towards the village shouting, Help! Help! Wolf! Help! Somebody! The villagers heard his cries but they laughed because they thought it was another trick. The boy ran to the nearest villager and said, A wolf is attacking the sheep. I lied before, but this time it is true! Finally, the villagers went to look. It was true. They could see the wolf running away and many dead sheep lying on the grass.
We may not believe someone who often tells lies, even when he tells the truth.
