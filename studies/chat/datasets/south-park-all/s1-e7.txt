Wendy: I know, but then, I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.

Stan: You what?!?

Stan bangs his head against a desk

Bully 1: Hehhehehe.

Bully 2: Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss.

Bully 1: Yeh, you want to be my girlfriend? Hehehe.

Stan bangs his head again.

Cartman: There, you see? All of a sudden my costume is pretty bad ass, huh?

Cartman: You're just jealous. Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?

Kyle: Wookies don't live on Endor!

Cartman: [In a mocking voice]Wookies don't live on Endor.

Kyle: Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Cartman: What?!? What did you say?!?

Mr. Garrison: Ok now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats.

The rest of the children go to their seats.

Mr. Garrison: Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins.

You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel 

Kenny's arm falls off.

Cartman: Who?

Kyle: Dude, I thought she was dead.

Stan: Yeh, me too.

Mr. Garrison: Thank you Miss Yothers.

Tina hands Mr. Garrison the results.

Tina places a second place ribbon on Kenny.

Mr. Garrison: And the award for the very best costume goes to Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!

Tina places a first place ribbon on Wendy.

Kyle: What?!? But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours Tina Yothers!

Tina looks on shocked.
 
 

Mr. Garrison: And the award for worst costume this year goes to Stan for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at

Stan and laugh children.



Stan: Thanks a lot Wendy, you ruined my Halloween.

Wendy: Relax Stan, you'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.

Stan: I don't want to trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.

Mr. Garrison: Ok children, let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first Bebe.

On the TV, Tom the newscaster gives an update on Mir.

Tom: And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussie

space station."

The backdrop shifts to a pair of pink eyes.

Tom: In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a

bikini.

Cut to the midget, where zombies are shown ransacking the town.

Midget: Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus.

Zombies are shown attacking another townsperson, and generally ransacking South Park.

Midget: Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes.

Chef: Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.

[Outside South Park]

Cartman: Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.

Stan: I bet I get more candy than you dude.

Cartman: Are you crazy?!? I'm the candy master.

Stan: No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.

Cartman: Hey, I'm not the one who walks around all day looking like Pippy Longstockings.

Stan: Oh yeh, well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Cartman: God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

Kyle walks up, now a vampire.

Kyle: Hey dudes.

Stan: Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight .

Cartman: Check.

Stan: Plastic pumpkin pails .

Kyle: Check.

Stan: Taser .

Kyle: What's that?

Stan: For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.

Cartman: Yeh, granola pisses me off.

Kyle, Stan: Hey Kenny.

Cartman: Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.

Kyle: You still didn't get a costume Kenny?



Cartman: Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.



Cartman: I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?!? Kenny?!? Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!



Cartman: I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.

Wendy: Hi guys.

Cartman: Hi Wendy.

Stan: How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!?

Wendy: Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.

Cartman: You what?!? Are you insane?!?

Wendy: Let's go trick-or-treats.

Stan: I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.

Wendy: Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.

Cartman: How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?

Stan: Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy.

Wendy: But Stan?

Stan: No buts Wendy, I wish you were dead.

They walk away.

Wendy looks dejected.

Zombie: Uhhhh!

Wendy screams as a shadow envelops her.
 
 

[South Park Clinic]

Chef: Doctor?

Doctor: Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?

Chef: No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.

Doctor: What the hell are you talking about?

Chef: Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town coincidence, oh I don't think so!

Doctor: Chef, I, I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Let, let me give you some, some topical cream.

Chef: Damn it, don't you see? These people have been venofied. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!

Chef tears off Mr. Torres' arm.

Mr. Torres is gushing blood.

Mr. Torres: Ahhh!

Doctor: Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef.

Chef: Oh, sorry.

Chef tries to replace Mr. Torres' arm.

Chef: But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.

Mr. Torres falls over, most likely dead from blood loss.

Doctor: Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years.

Chef: Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?

Doctor: Well, uh, it it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeh.

Zombies burst through the doctor's door.

Chef: Ahhhh!

Chef leaps out the doctor's window.

Doctor: Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.

The zombies attack the doctor.

Doctor: Ahh!

Barbrady is presently wearing a garter and fishnet stockings.

Mayor McDaniels stands up, her blouse in disarray.

Mayor: Uh, why, why Chef. What a surprise.

Barbrady: You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.

Chef: Actually, uh .

Mayor: Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.

Barbrady: Not a thingy-dingy.

Chef: I don't really give a crap. We've got to do something about the living dead!

Mayor: You mean, Tina Yothers?

Barbrady and McDaniels laugh.

Chef: No, damn it. I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park.

Barbrady: Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?

Barbrady and McDaniels laugh.

Chef: Ahh, the hell with you both.

Chef leaves the office.

Chef: Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?

Kyle: Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

Chef: Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.

Kyle: Costumes and candy.

Stan: Oh.

Cartman continues to wail.
