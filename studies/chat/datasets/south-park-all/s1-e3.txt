[Mr. Garrison's Classroom]

Kyle: Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?

Stan: Yeh, it was huge.

Cartman: Heh, I hate those things.

Kyle: Nobody hates rainbows.

Stan: Yeh, what's there to hate about rainbows?

Cartman: Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your

leg and start biting the inside of your ass. And you'll be all like, "hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows"

Stan: Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!?

Cartman: I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those frigging things!

Kyle: Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.

Cartman: Ohh, rainbowwws, oh yeh, I like those, those are cool.

Stan: What were you talking about?

Cartman: Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.

Kyle: No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?!?

Cartman: Nothing.

Mr. Garrison: Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last

month?

Mr. Garrison: One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.

Wendy: Wow, I knew I would win.

Mr. Hat: Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.

Mr. Garrison: That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is...

Mr. Garrison: Eric Cartman.

Wendy: What?

Cartman: What?

Mr. Garrison: Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.

Cartman: Kick Ass!

Stan: That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain forest from a pop tart.

Cartman: Yeh I do, pop tarts are frosted.

Mr. Garrison: Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.

Kyle: Wow, what did you write about Cartman?

Cartman: Oh, you know, this and that.

Wendy: He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

Kyle: What was your paper about Wendy?

Wendy: My paper was on the suffering of bottle nosed dolphins.

Cartman: There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.

Stan: Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

Cartman: Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?

Wendy: What?

Mr. Garrison: Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.

Kyle: Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?

Mr. Garrison: And the presentation will be on national television.

Stan,Kyle: Television!

Mr. Garrison: [Thinking to himself] Kathie Lee Gifford, I don't believe it.

[City Hall]

Mayor: Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that were not just

some piss-ant white bred mountain town.

Igg: Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.

Mayor: Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.

Oook: Maybe even a State Senator.

Igg: Mayor, we should decorate the town square.

Oook: Then we should have the chef of the school cafteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.

Mayor: That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?

Igg: Black as the night itself Mayor.

Mayor: Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.

Igg: If there working in a sweat-shop that is.

Oook: Ohhh.

Igg: Ouch.

Oook Laughs

Igg: Thank you.

[Cafeteria]

Cartman: You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.

Wendy: Hitler was famous too.

Chef: Hello there children.

Kyle, Stan: Hey chef.

Chef: How are my little crackers today?

Kyle, Stan: Good.

Chef: Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.

Stan: Yeh, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.

Cartman: Hey!

Chef: Yeh, yeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

Kyle: Wow, are you gonna do it?

Chef: Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of

exotic delectation.

Stan: Yeh, that'd be cool.

Kenny:

Chef: Well, three times bigger than Frank Giffords anyway.

Chef laughs suggestively

[Mr. Garrison's Classroom]

Mr. Garrison: Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.

Looks at Mr. Hat

Mr. Garrison: Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat: Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?

Mr. Garrison: Mmm,mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.

Mr. Hat: We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.

Lil Mr. Garrison: Knock, Knock Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat: Who's there?

Lil Mr. Garrison: Orange.

Mr. Hat: Orange who?

Lil Mr. Garrison: Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

One person claps

Mr. Hat: Thank you.

Judges show scores of 8.9, 9, 7.8 and 9.2

Lil Mr. Garrison: Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.

Show Announcer: And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

Lil Kathie Lee: [Singing]If they could see me now, that little crowd of mine. I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine. I'd like the

stumble bums to see for a fact...

Crowd goes wild

Judges show all 10's

[Back in the classroom]
 

Mr. Garrison: It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?

Mr. Hat: But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.

Mr. Garrison: How?

Mr. Hat whispers to Mr. Garrison

Mr. Garrison: No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!

[Mr. Garrison's Classroom]

Mayor: Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.

Cartman: That kid is me.

Mayor: Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.

Mr. Garrison: That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat: Kill Her.

Mr. Garrison: [Whispered]Mr. Hat!

Mayor: Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.

Mr. Garrison: Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.

Wendy: Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.

Mayor: Who cares? Now kids, whats say we give it our South Park best.

Mayor: And who's our little prize winner again?

Cartman: Me! Eric Cartman!

Mayor: How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

Cartman: Yes maam. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.

[Bus Stop]

Cartman: I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.

Stan: We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.

Cartman: Ehh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.

Stan: Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.

Cartman: Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.

Stan: Dolphins are way smarter than you.

Cartman: If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?

Stan: Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos.

Cartman: Dolphins, eskimos, who cares? It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap.

Stan: Tell me what you wrote about!

Cartman: I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.

Stan: Yeh, right. You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!

Cartman: Screw you, hippie.

[Cartman's House]

TV Announcer: We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this.

Beefcake: Hey! You need to get in shape fast?!? Wanna look your best?!? Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?!? Are you

tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!?

Cartman: Yeh, I only weight 90 pounds.

Beefcake: Then bulk up quick, with weight gain 4000!!

Cartman: Yes!

Beefcake: With over 4000 grams of saturated fat per serving, it's patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly

to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream.

Beefcake: Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me 'Beefcake!'

Cartman: Beefcake!

Beefcake: Beefcake!

Cartman: Beefcake!

Beefcake: Beefcake!

TV Announcer: May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver.

Cartman: Mom, can you get me some weight gain 4000.

Mrs. Cartman: Ok Eric, I'll get you some from the store tomorrow.

Cartman: But mom, I need it for tomorrow.

Mrs. Cartman: But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.

Cartman: (Throwing a fit)But mom....

Mrs. Cartman: Ok, ok, then I guess I'll be going to the store now then.

[Mr. Garrison's Bed]

Mr. Garrison hear's singing in his head

Kathie Lee: If the could see me know, that little crowd of mine...

Mr. Garrison: No, no!

Mr. Hat: Kill her.

Mr. Garrison: No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.

Mr. Hat: Kill!

Mr. Garrison: That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer Mr. Hat.

Mr. Hat: She'll make a fool of you again.

Mr. Garrison: Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.

[Bus Stop]

Cartman: Hey dudes.

Kyle: What the hell is wrong with you Cartman, haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?

Cartman: Shut it, I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?

Stan: What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.

Cartman: I'm up to 94, thank you very much.

Kenny:

Kyle: Yeh, they're almost as big as his mom's.



Cartman: Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.

Cartman Drinks Can of Weight Gain

Stan: What's that stuff?

Cartman: Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.

Kyle: Bulk up to what, fat ass.

Stan: Super-fat ass.

Cartman: Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings.

Bus Arrives

Cartman: Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.

[Town Square]

Mayor: Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!

[Stage]

Mayor: Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?

Mr. Garrison: Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.

Mayor: Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

Mr. Garrison: Ok, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage. Good. And all the little indians go to the center of the stage.

Clyde: Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?

Mr. Garrison: Do you have a feather on your head?

Clyde: Yeh.

Mr. Garrison: Then you're an Indian.

Clyde: Oh.

Mr. Garrison: Ok Bebe, this is your line.

BeBe: [Somewhat broken]This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hearty Ute

Indians lived on the land.

Mayor: Oh, don't they look adorable?

BeBe: Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.

Pioneers come on stage and start beating the Indians

Teepee falls on Kenny

Mayor: Oh my God!

Mr. Garrison: They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.

BeBe: The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.

Pioneer punches Indian repeatedly.

Mayor: Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

Mr. Garrison: Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.

Stan: Take that you stupid Indian!

Stan beats Indian with butt of gun

Mayor: Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?

Mr. Garrison: To Hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!

Mr. Garrison: Oh my God, what have I said.

Townsman: He said, "To Hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"

Mayor: Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.

[Mr. Garrison's House]

Mr. Hat: It happened again didn't it. Now we do things my way.

Mr. Garrison: I can't kill her Mr. Hat, you're gonna have to do it

Mr. Hat Laughs

[Stage]

Kyle: Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.

Cartman: Yeh, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.

Kyle: You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!

Cartman: I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape.

Kyle: Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"

Cartman: No they don't, you jealous weakling.

Townsman: God damn, that's a big fat ass!

Cartman: Hey!

Wendy: Hi guys.

Cartman: Oh look, another hippie. Peace Wendy.

Stan: Shut up Cartman.

Cartman: Ohhh, Two little hippies sitting in a tree....

Wendy: I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

[Jimbo's Gun Shop]

Jimbo: Can I help you?

Mr. Garrison: Yes, I need a gun.

Jimbo: Would this be for hunting, home protection or other?

Mr. Garrison: Other.

Jimbo: Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!

Hands Mr. Garrison a gun

Jimbo: That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.

Mr. Garrison: [To Mirror]You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo]You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.

Jimbo: Ok, how about this?

Mr. Garrison: [To Mirror]You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo]Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.

Jimbo: Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.

Mr. Garrison: [To Mirror]You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo]I'll take it.

[Mr. Garrison's Classroom]

Wendy: Hello?

Wendy sneaks over to file cabinet

Wendy: My essay by Eric Cartman: When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived lone in the woods on the

shore of...

Mr. Garrison enters

Wendy Hides

Mr. Garrison: Well Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent

show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!

Wendy: Oh my God.

[Town Square]

Enter Mr. Garrison with gun

Townsman: Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.

Mr. Garrison: Thank you.

Townswoman: Nice gun Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison: Thanks.

Approaches Officer Barbrady

Mr. Garrison: Hello Officer Barbrady

Barbrady: Nice Gun.

Mr. Garrison: Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.

Barbrady: Hmm, you know, I think the book despository would be a good bet

[Shot of Book Depository, with vultures circling]

Mr. Garrison: Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.

Barbrady: No problem. Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.

Mayor: Where is she?

Cartman: This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!

Kyle: I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.

Wendy: You guys, we have to stop him!

Kyle: Stop who?

Wendy: Mr. Garrison, he's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

Cartman: Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.

Wendy: He's got a gun!

Cartman: You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.

Wendy: It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!

Stan: Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?

Wendy: Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?

Kyle: Uh oh, we're losing him.

Mayor: Here she comes.

Band starts playing

Kathie Lee comes in riding in bullet proof 'bubble' on back of car

[Shot of Mr. Garrison in window of book depository]

Mr. Garrison: Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.

[On street]

Townswoman: We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh

Kathie Lee: I love you too

[Shot of Mr. Garrison in window]

Mr. Garrison: Come on you little bitch.

Mr. Garrison takes aim

Mr. Garrison: You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later missy.

[Stage]

Mayor: It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park

Mayor: And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford

Chef: Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way.

Or, or special in an extra value meal at happy burger way. No, no, no, no. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it

gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and

groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstacy [Singing]Oh, Kathie Lee, how I love to lay you down. And lick

every inch of your body with my tongue.

Mayor: What?

Chef: Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.

Mayor: What? Oh God!

Chef: How 'bout you and me

Mayor: Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.

Chef: get together and make sweet love?

Mayor: Thank you Chef!

Chef: Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!

[Town Square]

Wendy: Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!

Barbrady: What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.

Officer Barbrady flashes back

Mr. Garrison: Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.

Barbrady: Hmm, you know, I think the book despository would be a good bet, I think the book despository would be a good

bet, book despository, depository, depository, depository.

Officer Barbrady is back

Barbrady: Damn, he could be anywhere. I'll send out an APB.

Stan: Wendy, look!

Points to book depository

[Stage]

Mayor: And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...

Cartman: Cartman, God damn it.

Mayor: is your favorite celebrity, and mine...

Crowd Cheers

Mayor: Kathie Lee Gifford!

Secret Service looking guys throw Kathie Lee, still in her bubble, on tage

Kathie Lee: Thank you. How I love you all.

[Book Depository]

Stan: Mr. Garrison, stop!

Mr. Garrison: Leave us, we must finish what we have begun.

Wendy: I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.

Mr. Garrison: You can't know.

Wendy: You should have won that talent show.

[Stage]

Kathie Lee: It is with a great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?

Cartman: Here it is, my big moment of fame.

[Book Depository]

Mr. Garrison: And then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.

Wendy: I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.

Mr. Garrison: It is, too late for me, young Wendy.

Cartman gets on stage, with help from Kyle and Kenny.

Mr. Garrison takes aim.

Wendy: You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the

person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.

Mr. Garrison: You, you're right.

Wendy: Gooood.

Stan: Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once.

Mr. Hat: The bitch must die!

Cartman's weight breaks stage

Kathie Lee: Ooohhhh!

Kathie Lee's bubble flies off stage

Mr. Garrison shoots Kenny

Kenny: Oh my.

Kenny flies through air

Kenny is pierced by flag pole.

Kenny slides down flag pole (unfortunately leaving a bloody trail)

Kyle: Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!

Kathie Lee's bubble lands on car

Agent 1: Gun!

Agent 2: Gun!

Kyle: Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.

Car drives off

Crowd aahhhs

TV Crew Director: I guess that's it guys. Wrap it up.

Cartman: Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?

TV Crew Director: Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.

Cartman: [Whining]But I won the environmental essay contest.

Wendy: You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.

Wendy: [Into Mic]I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's

name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in it's place.

Townsman 1: Who Cares?

Townsman 2: Yeh, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

Stan: Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?

Wendy: Well, not if it's Cartman.

Wendy: [Into Mic]Hey, where are you all going!

Wendy: They don't even know what Walden is.

Wendy: [Into Mic]I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.

Stan: Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.

Wendy: Ah, what the hell.

Mayor: No, nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots.

Igg: Uh, Mayor, the mike is on.

[In front of flag pole]

Officer Barbrady is arresting Mr. Hat

Barbrady: Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?

Mr. Hat: Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids

Barbrady: You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt.

Kenny's corpse slides down to base of flag pole

[Mr. Garrison's Hospital Room]

Stan: We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison: Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.

Mr. Hat's in a straight jacket.

Mr. Hat: We can still get her. Let mmm.

Mr. Garrison: I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyones chances for being on TV.

Kyle: Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.

Mr. Garrison: Really, on what?

[Geraldo]

Geraldo: Obesity, Adiposity, Corpulence... What ever word you use, it represents one thing. Being a big fat ass. We have with us

today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house

Cartman: When is this going to be on the air?

Geraldo: Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?

Cartman: Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals. I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!

[Chef's Bedroom]

Chef: He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.

Kathie Lee: Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef.

Chef: Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
