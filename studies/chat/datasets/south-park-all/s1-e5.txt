 

[Bus Stop]

Cartman: Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?

Stan: Nothing, I mean, I mean, nowhere.

Cartman: Your sister beat you up again, huh?

Stan: No!

Cartman: Ehe, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.

Stan: She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.

Kyle: Yeh, but that sucks you get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.

Cartman: I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like: hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen

and make me some pie!

Stan: My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil

bitch!

Cartman: Be a man Stan. Say, "Heyy woman, ee, ee, you shut your mouth and make babies."

Stan: Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
 
 

Pan out to shot of huge elephant.
 
 

Kyle: You mean this one?

Stan: Yeh.

Kyle: He's my new pet elephant.

Stan: Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?

Kyle: I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.

Stan: Wow, that's cool!

Kyle: No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our

couch.

Cartman: That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.

Kenny: Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me they're like the same.

Stan: Well yeh, but pigs aren't smart like elephants.
 
 

The bus pulls up.
 
 

Ms. Crabtree: Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?

Kyle: Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.

Ms. Crabtree: Oh, I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
 
 

Shot of retarded kid bus.

[Retarded noises]
 
 

Kyle: Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.
 
 

The boys get on the bus.
 
 

Cartman: If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and  ."

Ms. Crabtree: SIT DOWN KID!!!

Cartman: Yes ma'am.
 
 

[Mr. Garrison's Classroom]

Mr. Garrison: And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.

Mr. Hat: That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and

make them better.

Kyle: Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison: Yes Kyle.

Kyle: With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?

Mr. Garrison: Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig

genes.

Kyle: That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make pot-bellied elephants.

Class: 

Kyle: They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.

Stan: That'd be cool!

Girl: I want a pot-bellied elephant.

Pip: Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

Terrence: That's stupid.

Kyle: Shut up Terrence, we can gentical engineer anything we want.

Terrence: Oh yeh, I bet I can gentically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

Kyle: I'll bet you can't.

Terrence: Watch me plebian.

Mr. Garrison: Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two a-plus students in a cloning war.

Mr. Hat: Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.

Mr. Garrison: You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could

both use this for your science fair projects next month.

Kyle: Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!

Stan: Wait, wait. We still need a pig.

Kyle: We can use Cartman's pig.

Cartman: Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this.

Kyle: We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.

Cartman: You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!

Mr. Garrison: Uh, uh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?

Stan: Ok.

Mr. Garrison: I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?

Stan: [Despondantly]Yes.

Mr. Garrison: Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.
 
 

Stan sits down.
 
 

Mr. Hat: I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father or your mother?

Stan: Oh, neither. It's my sister.

Mr. Garrison: Your sister?!? Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo

problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
 
 

[Stan's house]

TV Voice: Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions .

Shelly: Hey.

Robert: Yeh, is this Jesus?

Jesus: Yes, my son.

Stan: Hi Shelly.

Shelly: Are you looking at my headgear?

Stan: Headgear? What headgear?

Shelly: Are you looking at my headgear?

Stan: Oh, gosh, I didn't really notice.

Shelly: You little liar.

Stan: No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AHHHHH!
 
 

Shelly proceeds to beat the living hell out of Stan.

Shelly throws Stan down the stairs.

Shelly drops the TV on Stan's head.
 
 

Stan: Ah, ah, ah.
 
 

[Outside Stan's house]

Kyle: Ready to go Stan?

Stan: Go where?

Kyle: To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.

Kyle: We got Cartman's pig so we can splice it's genes with my elephant.

Cartman: Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
 
 

Zoom in to Shelly's face in the window
 
 

Shelly: I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!

Kyle: Why's your sister so mean to you dude?

Cartman: Yeh, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater

before I slap you in the face!"
 
 

Zoom in to Shelly's face in the window
 
 

Shelly: Who said that?
 
 

[Outside the gates of the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]

Kyle: This must be it.

Cartman: Yeh, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.

Kyle: No Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.

Cartman: It's ok Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.

Kyle: It's just a stupid pig.

Stan: Yeh, quit being such a baby.

Cartman: Baby?!? Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!

Stan: At least I'm not a little pig f%$%#$!

Cartman: Hey! I'm taking my pig and Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.

Kyle: What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!

Cartman: Hey! Why don't you go back to San Fransisco with the rest of the Jews?!?

Kyle: There's no Jews in San Fransisco, you retard!

Cartman: I'll kick you in the nuts!

Moreau: Can I help you?
 
 

Kenny pulls his hood closed
 
 

Kenny: Mmmmmm!

Kyle: Uh yeh we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.

Moreau: Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.

Kyle: No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.

Moreau: Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in.
 
 

[Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]

Moreau: I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.

Cartman: Eh, it's ok Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.

Moreau: It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I

have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.

Monkey: Mhhh.

Kyle: How does that make the world better?

Moreau: And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose.

Stan: Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?

Moreau: Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and

here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little, bunny fish.

Cartman: Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.

Moreau: And over here, swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.

Kyle: Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?

Moreau: Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Stan: Which song is that?
 
 

Zoom in to Moreau dancing and singing
 
 

Moreau: Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!

Moreau: Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.

Cartman: You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!

Moreau: You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.

Stan: Ow!

Moreau: Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me.

Kyle: Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?

Moreau: Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?

Kyle: Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.

Cartman: Come on Fluffy!

[Inside the Cafeteria]
 
 

Kid 1: This gas is just hurting my ass.

Kid 2: Yahh, that's pretty fresh. Oooh.

Cartman: I sure am hungry.

Pip: Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?

Pip: Lunchy munchies, hmmm?

Cartman: Go away Pip, nobody likes you!

Kyle: Yeh, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!?

Pip: Well, my father's family name being Pilip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue .

Cartman: God Damnit, would you shut the hell up!?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.

Stan: Yeh, go away Pip.

Pip: Right-O.
 
 

Pip walks off
 
 

Cartman: Dah, French people piss me off.
 
 

Terrence and Co approach
 
 

Terrence: Hey dumb asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?

Kyle: No! We're already halfway done.

Terrence: Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.

Bully 1: Yeh, prolly a gay pig too.

Bully 2: Stupid gay pig.

Kyle: It's more than you've got!

Terrence: Wronng. We've already got our human clone well under way.
 
 

One of the bullies pulls a foot out of a bag.
 
 

Kyle: Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
 
 

Foot kicks Cartman in the face
 
 

Cartman: Hey! Hey! I'll kick your ass!
 
 

Cartman kicks foot away

Foot lands in Pip's lunch tray
 
 

Pip: Ooohhooo!

Terrence: By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig.
 
 

Boys go to get their lunch
 
 

Chef: Hello there children.

Kyle: Hey Chef.

Chef: How you doin'?

Boys: Bad.

Chef: Why bad?

Kyle: We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.

Chef: Ahhhh, of course their genes won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

Chef: Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't .

Chef: A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea.

Kyle: I told you guys.

Chef: Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this.

Kyle: You hear that dudes? We'll be rich.

Chef: Forget about all that genetic engineering whoos-a-fudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make

sweeet love.

Cartman: Whaaat?!?

Stan: I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.

Cartman: I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.

Chef: Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.

Stan: So how do we do that?

Chef: Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
 
 

[At the bus stop]

Boys get off the bus
 
 

Stan: Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?

Kyle: We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.

Chef: Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?

Cartman: Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?

Stan: Shut up Cartman!

Kenny: Or are you gonna feather your hair?

Kyle: Yeh Stan, she's just a girl.

Cartman: Yeh, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making

me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"

Stan: Cartman?!? What the hell are you talking about?!?

Cartman: I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.

Kyle: Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly,

you're my sister, and I love you."

Kenny: And I want to take off your bra.

Stan: Sick dude, she's my sister.

Kyle: Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.

Cartman: No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!

Kyle: Come on Kenny.

Cartman: Kyle no, seriously. No f'n' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.

Stan: Crap.
 
 

[Stan's house]

Stan sneaks through the front door
 
 

TV Voice: And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access .

Shelly: Are you staring at my neckbrace?

Stan: No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?

Shelly: Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that you're my sister, and I love you.
 
 

Shelly smiles, Stan smiles, it looks like she's gonna let him go 
 
 

Stan: No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.

Shelly: You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!
 
 

[Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch]

Moreau: Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful.

Moreau: My son, I think we've finally done it.

Terrence: Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.

Bully 1: Hopefully not a gay clone.

Bully 2: Yeh, that was stupid.

Bully 1: Stupid.

Bully 2: That was stupid.
 
 

[Out in the hills somewhere]

Kyle is pumping a keg that the elephant is drinking from.
 
 

Kyle: Come on elephant, keep drinking.

Stan: Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.
 
 

Shot of Fluffy drinking from a trough labeled "BEER"
 
 

Kyle: Damn it! This is never gonna work.

Chef: Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entreprenural venture is going.

Kyle: Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.

Chef: Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the matress mambo. You

need to set the mood. Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
 
 

Chef goes over to boombox with a mic
 
 

Chef: [Singing] Tonight is a-right for love, you know I, want to touch you where the lights don't go. Tonight is a-right for love, love

Terrence: Dad, you're the best.

Moreau: Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.
 
 

Big Stan breaks out of "womb"
 
 

Moreau: Oh no, this entire expriment is turning out very bad.

Big Stan: Me bad??
 
 

Big Stan throws four-assed frog against wall, killing it.
 
 

Moreau: Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him.

Terrence: But he's our science fair project!

Big Stan: Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp.

Moreau: He's too dangerous son.

Terrence: But dad! I want a human clone.

Moreau: Son, no.
 
 

Big Stan jumps through window
 
 

Moreau: Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.

Terrence: They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go.

Bully 1: Yehh, they're all gay.
 
 

[Back on the Hill]

Shot of Fluffy and elephant sleeping together
 
 

Kyle: Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

Chef: Oh, they will. It's gonna be one ugly site.

Kyle: I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.

Stan: Yeh, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly.

Chef: Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.
 
 

Elephant begins to wake up
 
 

Chef: Uh oh, here we go.
 
 

Elephant looks down at Fluffy with surprise
 
 

Chef: Yehhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.
 
 

Fluffy looks up at elephant, begins crying
 
 

Chef: Or a big fat elephant.

Kyle: Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

Chef: Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.

Kyle: Couple of days? But Terrence is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.

Cartman: Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?
 
 

Kyle punches Cartman
 
 

Cartman: Hey!
 
 

Moreau approaches
 
 

Moreau: Oh thank Buddah I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?

Stan: Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.

Moreau: No, no, I said odd.

Chef: Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.

Moreau: Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy then uhhhhh hmmm oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a

bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.

Kenny: A big mutant Stan?!?

Stan: A big mutant version of me?

Kyle: Is he bigger than a regular clone?

Moreau: He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.

Tom: It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park.

Tom: When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp,

ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio.

TV Newscaster: Thank's Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his

body. That's all for now.

Big Stan: Ahhhh
 
 

Big Stan grabs Officer Barbrady and throws him into nearby pond
 
 

Barbrady: whoa

Barbrady: Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.

Kyle: Come on, let's go!
 
 

Uncle Jimbo approaches
 
 

Uncle Jimbo: There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!

Stan: It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
 
 

Mr. Garrison approaches, and he looks like hell
 
 

Mr. Garrison: Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!? You have got severe lunch room duty mister!

Uncle Jimbo: I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.

Mr. Garrison: Yeh, you wait 'til your father hears about this.

Kyle: Wait, Stan, there he goes.

Stan: Stop!

Big Stan: Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp.

Kyle: He recognizes you dude.

Stan: That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down.
 
 

Big Stan is now seated in the road.

Terrence: Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us.

Moreau: No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such inconvenience. I

tried to play God, and I failed.
 
 

Dr. Moreau shoots Big Stan through the head
 
 

Terrence: Daddy! Nooooo!

Moreau: All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's

creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.

Terrence: You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

Kyle: Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
 
 

Stan's parents drive up
 
 

Stan: Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy, you guys have got to help me.

Cartman: Oh yeh, watch me.

Kyle: Yeh Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya.

Stan: Thanks a lot.

sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
 
 

Stan's parents enter the front door.
 
 

Randy: Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

Mrs. Marsh: Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?

Shelly: It's not Stan's fault.

Randy: Huh?

Shelly: It wasn't Stan, he was it was just me the whole time.

Randy: Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conlusions.

Mrs. Marsh: Oh honey, please forgive us son.

Stan: Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family.

Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.
 
 

Shelly begins beating the crap out of Stan.

Kid 2: Oh wow!

Kid 3: What's it look like?

Kyle: Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?

Shot of pig that looks like, well 

Cartman: Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison: Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?

Stan,Kyle: Hmmm.

Mr. Garrison: You boys get first prize.
