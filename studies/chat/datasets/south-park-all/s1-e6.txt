Grandpa attempts to wheeze out the candles

Marsh Family: Hey!!!

Randy: How's it feel to be a hundred and two paps?

Grandpa: Shoot me.

Carol Marsh: Make a wish grandpa.

Grandpa: I wish I were dead

Randy: Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa.

Grandpa: I'm not being silly, kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.

Carol Marsh: Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?

Shelley: I will.

Randy: Me.

Stan: It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.

Shelley: That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.

Carol Marsh: Oh, alright, but take your grampy with you.

Stan: Ah, damn it!

Carol Marsh: Language.

[In front of the TV]

TV Announcer: And now back to 'Terrance & Phillip'

Phillip: Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

Terrance: Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.

Phillip rips a juicy one



Grandpa: Uhhhhh

Stan is laughing.

Grandpa is attempting to line a shotgun up with his face.



Grandpa: Ah, damn it!

Grandpa turns to Stan

Grandpa: How would you like to make a dollar Billy?

Stan: My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan.

Grandpa: Damn it Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?

Stan: Sure.

Grandpa: Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.

Stan: I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.

Grandpa: Why not?

Stan: Cause, I'll get in trouble.

Grandpa: I killed my grandpa when I was your age.

Stan: Leave me alone grandpa.





Grandpa: What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.

[Kyle's House]

Ike and Kyle are in front of the TV

Phillip: Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.





Terrance: Ohhh, you farted.

Kyle is laughing pretty hard.

Carol Broslofski: Kyle, boopie, what are you watching?

Terrance: Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

Phillip: I sure would Terrance.

Terrance: Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.





Carol Broslofski: What is this? It's horrible!

Kyle: Dude, it's 'Terrance & Phillip'.

Phillip: Take that you stupid dick.

Carol Broslofski: What did he say?

Terrance: You're an asshole Phillip.

Carol Broslofski: What what what?!!?



Carol Broslofski: Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore. It's immature toilet humor.

Kyle: But everybody watches 'Terrance & Phillip'.

Carol Broslofski: Oh really? Is that so?

[Cartman's House]

Terrance: Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

Phillip: You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.





Terrance: Oh no.



Cartman: Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!

Ms. Cartman: Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show

is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

Cartman: That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!

Ms. Cartman: Ohhh, ok hon.

[Stan's House]

Stan: I'm not going to kill you grandpa!

Grandpa: Ingrate!

Stan: Good night grandpa.

Grandpa: You pompous son of a whore!

[Mr. Garrison's Class]

Student: Huh huh, I had another ...

Kyle: Ow! What the hell was that for?!?

Cartman: That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss 'Terrance & Phillip' last night!

Clyde: Yeh, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?

Kyle: Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.

Cartman: Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time

every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end

up getting screwed by it!

Mr. Garrison: Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.

Cartman: Oh, jee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?

Mr. Garrison: She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naugthy show called

'Terrance & Phillip'.

Class: Yehh, woohoo!

Mr. Hat: Watching that show is bad Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison: That's right Mr. Hat, shows like 'Terrance & Phillip' are what we call 'toilet humor.'

They don't expand your minds.



Mr. Garrison: You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.

Kenny walks in.

Mr. Garrison: Kenny, why are you late to class?

Kenny hands Mr. Garrison a note.

The note reads 'Please excuse me from being late, I have a case of explosive

Diarreha, signed -K'

Mr. Garrison: Oh, ok Kenny, be seated.

Mr. Garrison: Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is

because...

Kenny is waving his hand frantically.

Mr. Garrison: Yes Kenny, what is it?

Kenny: I have to go fart.

Mr. Garrison: I thought you just came from the bathroom.

Kenny: I did, I gotta go do ...

Mr. Garrison: Ok ok, go ahead.

bathroom door creaks open and closed

Mr. Garrison: As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy the show, even though it isn't based in

reality.

Sounds of some serious diarreha come from the bathroom

Mr. Garrison: There's much more to life than two men farting on each other. And throughout

history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been

very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air.

The sounds continue, only now we here Kenny obviously not enjoying himself.

Mr. Garrison: You see, you should be spending your time enlightning your minds with more

intelligent entertainment.

Kenny reenters the classroom.

Stan: Woah, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!

Mr. Garrison: Pay attention children!

Mr. Garrison pounds on the lectern.

Mr. Garrison: I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch 'Terrance & Phillip'

any more, ever.

Clyde: What? Not watch 'Terrance & Phillip' ever?

Mr. Garrison: That's right children. Are there any questions?

Stanley has his hand raised.

Mr. Garrison: Yes Stanley?

Stan: Is it ok to kill somebody if the want you to?



Mr. Garrison: What, what do you mean?

Stan: My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I

should.

Kyle: Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.

Stan: Really??

Kyle: Yeh, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people

that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.

Stan: Wow!

Cartman: Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!

Stan: So, is it ok to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison: Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty foot pole.

Kenny: Oh my God!

The bathroom door creaks as Kenny runs into the bathroom

Immediately a large splatter of diarreha is let loose by Kenny.

Kenny: Owww!

[splatterrrrr!]

[Cut to Commercial]

[School Cafeteria]

Cartman: Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss 'Terrance & Phillip' today. I think I'm already

having withdrawal.

Cartman starts convulsing and making seizure related sounds.

Stan: Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home

until late.

Kyle: But won't your grandpa be there?

Stan: Yeh...

Cartman: Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.

Chef: Hello there children.

Stan: Hey Chef.

Chef: How's it goin'?

Stan: Bad.

Chef: Why bad?

Stan: Chef, is it ok to kill your grandpa?

Chef: You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on.

Stan: No, I mean: ill my grandpa.

Chef: No, I don't think that's ok Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.

Stan: See, I told you dude.

Kyle: Well, yeh, but what if the grandpa want's to die, cause he's really old, and he's just

asking for help?

Cartman: Yeh, like assisted suicide. What about that?

Chef utters a few uhs as he contemplates how to approach the topic...

Chef: I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.

Stan: What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.

[PTA Meeting]

Mrs. Broslofski: And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to

demonstrate exactly what I mean.

Terrance: Hey Phillip, guess what?

Phillip: What?

Terrance rips a fart as he says:Terrance: Fart.

Mrs. Broslofski: Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.

Randy: Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, ohhh.

Other PTA members stare at Randy in shock.

Mrs. Broslofski: Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the

entire network! All those in favor...

Loud, juicy fart comes from the little boys room.

Mr. Garrison: Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the

green apple splatters.



Townsman: Huh, huh, green apple splatters.

[Stan's House]

Grandpa: Uhhhh

Stan: Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's ok.

Grandpa: Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet.

Stan: No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.

Grandpa: Kill me, God damn it!

Stan: No, I can't even kill a deer.

Grandpa: Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?

Cartman: I would never kill somebody...not unless the piss me off.

Grandpa: Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over

here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.

Cartman: What!

Grandpa: That's right.

Stan: Grandpa!

Grandpa: And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.

Cartman: Hey!

Grandpa: Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.

Cartman: You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

Grandpa: That's the spirit Tubby.

Stan: Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

Cartman: Don't talk about my mom like that!

Stan: We can go watch 'Terrance & Phillip' in the kitchen.

Grandpa: I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad Fatso?

Cartman: Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!

Stan: Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.

Cartman: Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.

Stan: I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.

Kyle: I'm telling you, it's ok. Maybe you should ask the lord for guidance.

Stan: Hey, yeh!

[Stan's House, kitchen]

TV Announcer: And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.

Jesus: Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.

Jesus presses a button on the phone.

Jesus: First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'

Sounds of feedback

Martin: Yeh, is this Jesus.

Jesus: Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird

feedback.

Martin: Oh, sorry. Uh, this is Martin...

Jesus: Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.

Martin: How the hell'd you know that?

Jesus: Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?



Martin: Uh, yeh, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and

Jesus: Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the

circumstance.

Martin: Oh, oh, ok, thanks for the advice, Jesus.

Jesus presses a button on the phone.

Jesus: Next caller, you're on the air.

Stan: Jesus?

Jesus: Yes my son?

Stan: Jesus, is, is it ok to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of

pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that ok?

Jesus: My son...

Stan: Yes?

Jesus: I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.

Jesus presses a button on the phone.

Jesus: Next caller.

Stan: God damn it!

Jesus: I heard that.

Stan: What the hell is wrong with everybody?

Cartman: Hey you guys, 'Terrance & Phillip' is on!

Kyle: Yeh, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?

Stan: Kyle, don't be such a butthole!

Cartman: Yeh, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to

suffer.

Kyle: Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Cartman: Oh, biiitch. Your--mom--is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.

TV Announcer: And now back to 'Terrance & Phillip'.

Terrance: Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.

Phillip: Oho yeh, I love beans.

Cartman: Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

Grandpa: Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?

Stan: Ok grandpa, ok, just get out of the way of the TV.

Terrance: Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

Phillip: Well, don't fart on me Terrance.

Cartman: Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.

Kenny: Oh my God!

Kenny runs to the bathroom.

Cartman: Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.



Phillip: You're such an asshole Terrance.

Terrance: Haha, charade I am.



[Disgusting diarreha sounds]

Kenny: Ow!

Cartman: Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.

Shelley: Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

Stan: We're not watching 'Terrance & Phillip', I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching

it.

Shelley: No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa!?!

Stan traces the rope he's holding to a hanging grandpa.

Grandpa: Tug - a - little harder, Billy.

Stan: Ahh.

Stan lets go of the rope.

Grandpa falls to the ground, landing on his side.

Grandpa: Uh, ow.

Shelley: You little jerk!

Shelley slugs Stan in the face.

Shelley: You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!

Grandpa: Damn it! I was so close.

[TV Screen]
 
 

TV Announcer: Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to vicously murder

an innocent grandfather.

Talk Show Host: Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such

demonic little bastards?

Stan: We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching 'Terrance

& Phillip' and ....

Talk Show Host: Terrance & Phillip', aha! So it is that show that is to blame.

[In front of Tom's Rhinoplasty]

Mrs. Broslofski: These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see,

and we are fed up!

Crowd: Woooo!

Townsman: Huh? Oh god! Oh god!

South Parkian runs into a 'Port-a-potty'

Mrs. Broslofski: We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and

protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!

Sound of a deep, sonorous fart, with juice.

[Cut to Commercial]

[In front of Cartoon Central]

Mrs. Broslofski: We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television,

for our children!

Loud cheering from the crowd.

Mrs. Broslofski: We want more quality television, like 'Full House'.

Loud cheering from the crowd.

Randy: Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu Mr. Garrison.

Mr. Garrison: No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.

Randy: Whoa Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.

Mayor

McDaniels: I just had a brown baby boy.



[Stan's House]

Stan's house is in disarray.

The kids are playing ball and flying kites.

Stan: Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.

Kyle: Yeh, I hope they protest TV shows forever.

Stan: Whoopeee!

Grandpa: Come here Billy, I want to show you something.

Stan: Ahh, do I have to?

Grandpa: Yes you do, you little pecker!

Grandpa: I realized that the reason you won't kill me is because you don't understand how I

feel, Billy. But now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa.

Stan: Hey, what are you doing?!?

Grandpa loads a cassette into a tape player.

Kyle: What are they doing in there?

Cartman: I don't know.

Grandpa: Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?

Stan: Uh, I guess.

Grandpa starts the tape, it is a really distorted sounding version of Enya's 'Orinoco

Flow(Sail Away)'

Stan: Ok, you, you can let me out now.

Grandpa: Not just yet.

Stan: Let me out grandpa!

Stan: I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily

soothing at the same time.

Grandpa: That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa.

Stan falls out of the room, looking very haggard.

Stan: Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.

Grandpa: So now will you kill me Billy?

Stan: Sure I will grandpa, I will.

[In front of Cartoon Central, New York]

Ms. Cartman: Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.

Mrs. Broslofski: It'll work, it has to.

Townsman: Look! It's the president of the network.

John Warsog: Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warsog, I've prepared a statement for you

on behalf of the network.

He clears his throat a couple of times...

John Warsog: Fuck you.

John Warsog: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there any questions, you may direct them to

that brick wall over there.

He walks back into the building.

Mrs. Broslofski: Hey, you will not get away with this!

He moons the crowd.

They gasp in shock.

He closes the door behind them.

Mrs. Broslofski: That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.

Ms. Cartman: Ohho, Carol, where are the Porta-Potties?

Mrs. Broslofski: Over there hon, what, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?

Ms. Cartman: Ohhh, yes, indeedy.

They laugh.

[Outside of Stan's house somewhere]

Stan: Ok grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.

Stan: [To Kyle]You got the cow all tied up?

Kyle: Yep, all done.

Stan: Kay, come on guys.

Sounds of the boys struggling to lift a cow over grandpa's head.

Cartman: Why don't we just shoot him?

Stan: You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.

Kyle: Yeh, stupid!

Grandpa: That's good Billy, a little higher now.

Cow: Moooo!

[In front of Cartoon Central]

Carol Broslofski: The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what

they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?

Mr. McKormick positions himself in front of a large sling shot.

Mr. McKormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these

corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!

Mr. McKormick is flung into the front of the Cartoon Central building, splattering

into bloody death.



Carol Broslofski: We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.

Sounds of abdominal pains as people line up to the porta-potties.

[Outside of Stan's house somewhere]

Stan: Are you ready grandpa?

Grandpa: Does the pope crap in the woods?



Officer Barbrady drives up.

He is staring at the scene of a cow dangling above grandpa by a rope.

Stan stands off to the side, knife in hand, ready to cut the rope.

Police Radio: 73-5, code 6 - 105, North Avenue, 52.

Cow: Mooo!

Barbrady: Carry on.

Officer Barbrady starts the car back up and drives away.

Stan: Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.

Grandpa: Uhh, cut the damn rope already!

Sounds of thunder.

Lightning flashes

Stan: What is that?!?

Kyle: Well, it, it looks like...Death!

Death: Mrrrrr!

Grandpa: It's about time you lazy ass son of a whore.

Death approaches grandpa.

Grandpa: Come on, let's go.

Death continues past grandpa, towards the kids.

Grandpa: What the?

Stan: Hey, he's coming towards us.

Kyle: Why is death coming after us?

Death: Mrrr.

Kids: Ahhh!

[Stan's House]

The kids run away, into Stan's house.

They run towards Stan's room, Death in pursuit.

Stan struggles to open the door.

Cartman: Ahhhh, run, run, run.

Finally, they enter the room.

Stan bars the door with his body.

Death: Mrrr.

Death bangs on the door.

Kyle: What are we gonna do?

Death: Mooorrrr!

[In front of Cartoon Central]

Newscaster: As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot

their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under

incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their

sponsors.

Carol Broslofski: Here Carol, I think it's your boy.

Carol Marsh: Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?

Stan: Mom! Death is here, and and and he's trying to take us all away with him!

Carol Marsh: Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very

importan for your little well-being there.

Stan: Yeh, but, mom!

Carol Marsh: Here honey, talk to your father.

Randy: Did you turn the heat down?

Stan: Dad, death is coming!

Randy: Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.

He hangs up.

[Stan's House]

Death: Mrrrr!

Death continues to bang on the door.

Stan: Damn it! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about

what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their

kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.

Kyle: Yeh, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it

as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.

Kenny: Well, what I think, basically, is that...mrmmrmrmm

Stan: Totally dude.

Kyle: Good point man.

Death: Mrrrr!

Death cuts through the door with his scythe.

Kids: Ahhhh!

Stan: Quick, jump through the window.

Cartman: Ehh, eh, ehhhh!

Kenny pushes Cartman out the window and follows.

Death: Mrrrr!

[Cut to Commercial]

[South Park Avenue]

Kids: Ahhhh!

Death is following the kids on a tricycle.

Grandpa: Come back here you pompetous son of a pansy!

Kids: Ahhh!

Kyle: Don't let him touch you, you die if he touches you.

Grandpa: Come over here you son of a whore.

Phillip: Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?

Terrance: Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?





Phillip: Oh, you farted.

Death laughs.

Terrance: Ohho God.

Death is laughing uncontrollably.

Terrance: Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

Phillip: No Terrance, why don't you tell me?

Terrance: Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!



Death laughs.

Stan: Hey look!



Phillip: Oh, there's one.

The kids join Death in watching the show.

They are all laughing.

[In front of Cartoon Central]

Newscaster: Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves

in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that

seems to be going around is...

Newscaster: wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a

statement.

The door to 'Toon Central opens.

The president emerges wearing a gasmask.

Townsman: Wait, wait.

John Warsog: Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your

rancid feces ... has worked.

Shot of a large pile of crap lying in front of the two porta-potties.

John Warsog: Therefore, today we will be officially taking 'Terrance & Phillip' off the network and

replacing it with reruns of 'She's the Sheriff', starring Suzanne Somers.

The crowd cheers.

John Warsog: Now get away from here, and take your diarreha with you!

The crowd continues to cheer.

Townsman: Huh, oh no!

Carol Broslofski: At last, now we can return to normality.

[Television store in downtown South Park]

Terrance: Hey Phillip?

Phillip: Yes Terrance?

Terrance: Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

Phillip: Well I don't know Terrance, let me check.

Cartman: Uh oh, don't look there Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.

The TV shows some static.

TV Announcer: We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.

Death: Mrrrrr!

Kids: Ahhh!

[South Park Avenue]

Death turns and touches Kenny, killing him.

Kyle: Oh my God! They killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!

Stan: Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

Grandpa: Hey, you were supposed to kill me

Death: Mrrr.

Grandpa: That's not fair, God damn it! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it.

Death points a cold finger up the street.

From a misty haze emerges an incredibly haggard looking ghost of a man.

Stan: Whoa!

Great-Grandpa: Billllyyyy

Grandpa: Grandpa?

Great-Grandpa: That's right Billy.

Grandpa: My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all

haggard?

Great-Grandpa: I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity

in limbo.

Grandpa: Limbo?

Great-Grandpa: I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy

in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what

you're doing to his.You must wait to die of natural causes.

Grandpa: But I've been waiting for 25 years.

Great-Grandpa: Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural

causes....

Death, great-grandpa and Kenny's ghost fade away into the mist.

Stan: Come on you guys, let's go home.

A rat comes up and takes Kenny's corpse away.

[Stan's House]

Carol Broslofski: Here they are!

Randy: Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.

Stan: What do you mean?

Carol Marsh: We got 'Terrance & Phillip' taken off the air.

Cartman: You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!

Carol Broslofski: But look what they put on.

Mrs. Broslofski turns on the TV.

TV Announcer: And now back to 'She's the Sheriff'

Cartman: Nooo! God, Noooo!

Suzanne: You are the one behind all these shenanigans.

Dude: Yeh, well you're the stupid ho that started it.

Carol Broslofski: What did he say?

Suzanne: Up yours, buttmunch.

Carol Broslofski: What what what!!!

Carol Broslofski: Come on everybody, back to New York!

Kyle: Hey Stan, now that 'Terrance & Phillip' has been taken off the air, what are we

going to do for entertainment?

Stan: I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.

Cartman: My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda coool.

Kyle: Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?

Stan: Cool!

Cartman: Yeh!

Grandpa wheels up wearing a touristy shirt, carrying an Africa brochure.

Stan: What are you doing grandpa?

Grandpa: I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally

by lions in Africa every year?

Stan: That's my silly grandpa.
