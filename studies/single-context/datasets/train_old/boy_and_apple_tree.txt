No more trunk for you to climb on. I am too old for that now the man said.
I really cannot give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots, the tree said with tears.
I do not need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years, the man replied.
Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest, come sit down with me and rest. The man sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.
This is a story of everyone. The tree is like our parents. When we were young, we loved to play with our Mum and Dad. When we grow up, we leave them; only come to them when we need something or when we are in trouble. No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything they could just to make you happy.
You may think the boy is cruel to the tree, but that is how all of us treat our parents. We take them for granted; we don’t appreciate all they do for us, until it’s too late. Wallahi, May Allah forgives us of our shortcomings and may He guide us.
