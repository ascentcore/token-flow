I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way, [Zazu bows over one wing.] so you'd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning.
[With Scar distracted, the mouse wriggles out of his grasp and escapes into a nearby hole in the wall.]
Oh, now, look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.
Ha! You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
[Zazu crosses his wings huffily.]
Oooh, I quiver with fear!
[Scar crouches and bares his teeth at Zazu, who backs away fearfully.]
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way. Help!
[Zazu tries to fly away, but Scar catches him in his jaws. Mufasa's paw steps into view behind Scar.]
Scar?
[Scar looks at Mufasa over his shoulder, his cheeks puffed out.]
Mm-hmm?
Drop him.
[Zazu's beak pokes out of Scar's mouth.]
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty. [Scar spits out Zazu, who sits up with saliva-plastered wings.] Ugh.
Why, if it isn't my big brother [Scar saunters toward Mufasa.] descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
[Scar turns and saunters away.]
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful! [Scar drags his claws along the wall, creating a screeching sound that makes Zazu cringe.] Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, [Zazu flies accusingly into Scar's face.] as the king's brother, you should've been first in line!
[Scar snaps his jaws shut, causing Zazu to take refuge behind Mufasa's leg.]
Well, I was first in line... [Zazu peeks out at Scar, indignant.] until the little hairball was born.
[Scar thrusts his face toward Zazu, who ducks back behind Mufasa's leg. Mufasa lowers his head to Scar's level.]
That hairball is my son [Mufasa and Scar lift their heads simultaneously.] and your future king.
Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.
[Scar turns and walks away.]
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
[Scar looks over his shoulder at Mufasa.]
Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
